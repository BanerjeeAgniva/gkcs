# System Design Basics Notes

## Overview

When designing scalable systems, consider:
1. **Architectural components**
2. **How components interact**
3. **Tradeoffs in usage and design**

Premature scaling is often inefficient. Instead, plan with scalability in mind to avoid costly reworks later.

## Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems

### 1. Scalability
**Definition**: Ability of a system to handle growing workload gracefully.

#### Types:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers.
  - *Example*: Cassandra, MongoDB
- **Vertical Scaling**: Add resources (CPU/RAM) to existing server.
  - *Example*: MySQL

> **Tip**: Horizontal scaling supports dynamic growth better.

---

### 2. Reliability
**Definition**: The probability that a system fails within a given time.

- Ensures system continues functioning even when some components fail.
- Achieved through **redundancy**.

**Example**: In an e-commerce platform like Amazon, a user’s cart must persist even if a server crashes.

---

### 3. Availability
**Definition**: System uptime during a specific period.

- High availability ≠ High reliability.
- Achievable via rapid failover and repair mechanisms.

**Example**: An aircraft with low downtime is *available*. One that survives all weather conditions is *reliable*.

> A system can be available but not reliable.

---

### 4. Efficiency
**Measures**:
- **Latency**: Time to receive first item.
- **Throughput**: Items delivered per second.

> Consider:
- Network load
- Hardware/software heterogeneity
- Topology variation

---

### 5. Serviceability / Manageability
**Definition**: Ease of diagnosing, maintaining, and repairing the system.

- Early fault detection reduces downtime.
- Auto-diagnosing systems improve maintainability.

**Example**: A server automatically contacting support on fault detection.

## Load Balancing

### What is Load Balancing?
Distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve **availability** and **responsiveness**.

### Placement:
- Between user and web servers
- Between web servers and app/cache layers
- Between internal layers and DBs

---

### Benefits
- Faster service and lower latency
- High throughput and reduced downtime
- Predictive insights for bottlenecks
- Reduced stress per server

---

### Load Balancing Algorithms

#### 1. Least Connection
- Chooses server with fewest active connections.
- *Use case*: Long-lived connections.

#### 2. Least Response Time
- Picks server with fewest connections *and* lowest response time.

#### 3. Least Bandwidth
- Chooses server with lowest current traffic (Mbps).

#### 4. Round Robin
- Cycles through servers evenly.
- *Use case*: Equal server specs, short-lived requests.

#### 5. Weighted Round Robin
- Weights servers by capacity.
- Higher weight = more requests.

#### 6. IP Hash
- Uses hash of client IP to pick server.
- Ensures client always hits the same server.

---

### Redundant Load Balancers

> A single LB is a potential **SPOF** (Single Point of Failure).

- Use **dual LBs** in a cluster to monitor and replace each other on failure.

---

## Caching

### What is Caching?
Caches store frequently accessed data in a fast-access layer to reduce latency and load on backend systems.

> **Principle**: Locality of reference — recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again.

### Why Use Caching?
- Reduces response time
- Offloads backend services
- Makes high-demand requirements feasible

---

### Application Server Cache
- Cache is local to the request-handling node.
- Stored in **memory** (fastest) or **disk** (slower, but faster than network).
- Works best in single-node environments.
-  **Challenge** in multi-node: cache inconsistency due to random request routing.

---

### Global / Distributed Cache
Used to overcome cache misses in distributed setups:
- Shared cache among nodes (e.g., Redis, Memcached)

---

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Used for static media (images, videos, etc.).

**How it works**:
1. Request hits CDN.
2. If content available → served.
3. Else → fetch from origin, cache, and serve.

> **Tip**: Serve media from `static.domain.com` for future CDN migration ease.

### Cache Invalidation Strategies

| Strategy            | Description                                                                 | Pros                       | Cons                            |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Write-through**   | Write to cache **and** DB at same time                                       | Strong consistency          | Higher write latency             |
| **Write-around**    | Write directly to DB, bypass cache                                           | Avoids cache pollution      | Potential read misses            |
| **Write-back**      | Write to cache first, write to DB asynchronously                             | Fast writes                 | Risk of data loss on crash       |

---

### Cache Eviction Policies

| Policy       | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| FIFO         | Removes oldest added items first                         |
| LIFO         | Removes most recent items first                          |
| LRU          | Removes **least recently used** items                    |
| MRU          | Removes **most recently used** items                     |
| LFU          | Removes **least frequently used** items                  |
| RR           | Removes random items                                     |

## Data Partitioning (Sharding)

### What is Sharding?
Splitting a large DB into smaller pieces across servers to improve:
- Performance
- Manageability
- Load balancing
- Availability

> **Why?** Horizontal scaling is cheaper and more flexible than vertical scaling.

---

### Partitioning Methods

#### 1. Horizontal Partitioning
- Split by rows (e.g., ZIP codes `< 10000` vs `>= 10000`)
- Also called **range-based** sharding

>  Unbalanced partitions if data is skewed

---

#### 2. Vertical Partitioning
- Split by feature or table (e.g., users, photos, followers in separate DBs)

>  May still need horizontal partitioning later

---

#### 3. Directory-based Partitioning
- Use a **lookup service** to determine data location

>  Easy to rebalance  
>  Adds complexity and a new **SPOF** (single point of failure)

---

### Partitioning Criteria

| Type                  | Description                                                            |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hash-based**        | `hash(ID) % N` determines server                                       |
| **List-based**        | Explicit value-to-shard mapping (e.g., Nordic countries in 1 shard)    |
| **Round-robin**       | `i-th` record → `(i mod N)-th` partition                               |
| **Composite**         | Combine methods (e.g., List + Hash)                                    |

---

### Challenges in Sharding

#### a. Joins and Denormalization
- Joins across shards are slow
- Solution: Denormalization (but leads to data duplication/inconsistency)

#### b. Referential Integrity
- Foreign keys across shards not supported
- Enforce integrity in **application logic**

#### c. Rebalancing
Reasons to rebalance:
- Skewed data (hotspots)
- Uneven load

>  Downtime likely unless using **directory-based partitioning**

---

### Summary

| Strategy            | Strength                         | Weakness                         |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Horizontal          | Scalable, simple to implement     | Risk of skewed data              |
| Vertical            | Clean separation by feature       | Not scalable in the long term    |
| Directory-based     | Easy rebalancing                 | Extra layer of complexity        |
