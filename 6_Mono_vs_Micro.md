# Monolith vs. Microservices

## Introduction
- **Monolith**: A system where the entire application runs as a single unit.  
- **Microservices**: A system where functionalities are broken into smaller, independent services.  

---

## Common Misconceptions

1. **Monoliths do not have to be a single machine**  
   - Monoliths can be horizontally scaled with multiple machines.  
   - Clients do not connect to just one machine but to multiple servers that share the load.  

2. **Microservices are not necessarily tiny**  
   - A microservice is a **business unit** containing all related data and functions.  
   - There might be only a few microservices in a system, depending on requirements.  
   - Clients often connect to a **gateway**, which routes requests to the appropriate microservices.

## **Advantages of Monoliths**
1. **Easier for small teams**  
   - Less overhead in managing multiple services.  
   - A cohesive team can maintain a monolith efficiently.  

2. **Fewer moving parts**  
   - No need to manage inter-service communication.  
   - Deployment is simpler since everything is packaged together.  

3. **No code duplication**  
   - Shared setup code (e.g., database connections, testing setup) exists in one place.  

4. **Faster execution**  
   - No network calls (RPC).  
   - All function calls happen locally.

## **Disadvantages of Monoliths**
1. **Difficult onboarding for new developers**  
   - Developers need to understand the entire system before contributing.  

2. **Complicated deployments**  
   - Any code change requires redeploying the whole system.  
   - Frequent deployments must be carefully monitored.  

3. **Testing complexity**  
   - Highly coupled components make testing harder.  

4. **Single point of failure**  
   - If the monolith crashes, the entire system goes down.  
   - No partial failure handling like in microservices.

## **Advantages of Microservices**
1. **Easier to scale**  
   - Each service handles only a specific concern.  
   - Scaling individual services is more efficient.  

2. **Simpler onboarding for developers**  
   - A developer only needs to understand their assigned microservice.  

3. **Parallel development**  
   - Different teams can work on separate services without affecting each other.  

4. **Better resource allocation**  
   - Services experiencing high traffic can be scaled independently.  

---

## **Disadvantages of Microservices**
1. **Difficult to design**  
   - Requires careful architecture decisions.  
   - Poorly designed microservices may create unnecessary dependencies.  
   
2. **Over-fragmentation risk**  
   - If a service constantly communicates with just one other service, they may be better as a single unit.

## **Examples**
- **Monolith Success Story**: **Stack Overflow** operates successfully with a monolith.  
- **Microservices Usage**: **Google, Facebook, Amazon** and many others rely heavily on microservices.

## **System Design Interview Considerations**
- **For large-scale systems, microservices are usually preferred**.  
- If justifying a microservice approach, emphasize:  
  - Scalability  
  - Parallel development  
  - Easier onboarding  
  - Fault isolation  
- If directed toward a monolith, highlight:  
  - Simplicity for small teams  
  - Fewer moving parts  
  - Better performance for tightly coupled systems
