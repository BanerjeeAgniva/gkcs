# **System Design Concepts Explained with a Pizza Restaurant Example**

## **1. Vertical Scaling**
- **Example**: A pizza parlor with only one chef.
- **Problem**: As the number of customers increases, a single chef cannot handle all orders.
- **Solution**: Ask the chef to work harder, optimize processes, and pay them more.
- **Technical Term**: Vertical Scaling - Increasing the capacity of a single machine (or chef).
  
## **2. Preprocessing using Cron Jobs**
- **Example**: Preparing pizza dough during non-peak hours (e.g., 4 AM).
- **Why?** Reduces workload during peak hours.
- **Technical Term**: Preprocessing - Performing tasks beforehand to optimize performance.

## **3. Backup Servers**
- **Example**: If the only chef falls sick, the business stops.
- **Solution**: Hire a backup chef to avoid downtime.
- **Technical Term**: Backup servers prevent a single point of failure (Master-Slave Architecture).

## **4. Horizontal Scaling**
- **Example**: Instead of increasing one chef’s workload, hire multiple chefs.
- **Solution**: Add more chefs (resources) to handle the growing business.
- **Technical Term**: Horizontal Scaling - Adding more machines to distribute the load.

## **5. Microservices**
- **Example**: Different chefs specialize in different items:
  - Chefs 1 & 3 make pizzas.
  - Chef 2 specializes in garlic bread.
- **Solution**: Assign orders based on specialization.
- **Technical Term**: Microservice Architecture - Dividing responsibilities among services.

## **6. Distributed Systems**
- **Example**: If one pizza shop has a power outage, orders stop.
- **Solution**: Open multiple pizza shops in different locations.
- **Technical Term**: Distributed Systems - Creating multiple independent servers for fault tolerance.

## **7. Load Balancing**
- **Example**: Two pizza shops:
  - Shop 1 has a longer wait time (1 hour 15 min).
  - Shop 2 has a shorter wait time (1 hour 5 min).
- **Solution**: Route orders to the shop with the shortest delivery time.
- **Technical Term**: Load Balancer - A system that distributes requests efficiently.

## **8. Decoupling**
- **Example**:
  - The pizza shop focuses only on making pizzas.
  - The delivery agents focus only on delivering orders.
- **Solution**: Separate different responsibilities for flexibility.
- **Technical Term**: Decoupling - Separating concerns to make systems independent.

## **9. Logging and Metrics Calculation**
- **Example**: 
  - If a chef’s oven breaks, pizza-making slows down.
  - If a delivery agent's bike breaks, delivery times increase.
- **Solution**: Log events to track system performance and identify bottlenecks.
- **Technical Term**: Logging & Metrics - Collecting and analyzing system data.

## **10. Extensibility**
- **Example**: 
  - A delivery agent currently delivers pizzas.
  - Tomorrow, they might deliver burgers.
- **Solution**: Design the system to accommodate future changes without rewriting code.
- **Technical Term**: Extensibility - Building flexible, future-proof systems.

## **High-Level Design vs. Low-Level Design**
- **High-Level Design (HLD)**: 
  - Focuses on overall system architecture, scalability, and interaction between components.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**:
  - Focuses on coding details, classes, objects, and function signatures.

This structured approach ensures that the system is scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient.
